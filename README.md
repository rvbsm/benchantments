|:----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feather Falling | Less likely to trample farmland.                                      |
| Silk Touch      | Only break one half of the double slab if the player is sneaking.     |
| Fire Aspect     | Ignite the TNT and lit campfires and candles on use. (Bedrock parity) |
| Impaling        | Increases the damage done to mobs in water or rain. (Bedrock parity)  |
| Loyalty         | The trident returns if thrown into the void.                          |
| Mending         | Repairs all items in players' inventory, not just gear.               |
